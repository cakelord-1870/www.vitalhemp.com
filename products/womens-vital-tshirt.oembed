These hemp clothes will last you a long time if you take care of them. As many in the hemp industry say about hemp: “You don’t wear it out; you wear it in.” Our garments are garment-dyed, they have already been shrunk to the max. The will not shrink any more; though the fabric may relax a bit over time.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSuggestions for care: In general, you don’t need to baby hemp. Machine wash cold or warm. Tumble dry warm, or line dry (best not to dry in high heat). Avoid bleach, velcro and any hardware that can snag. Avoid uneven exposure to the sun as the sunlight may fade the color.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIroning: Our knits don’t generally need to be ironed. If you want to iron our 100% hemp wovens to make them look brand new again, use a hot iron on the linen setting and use steam.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHempjucation: The first jeans were made from hemp; but they lasted too long; so the business switched to cotton. Cotton uses 25% of all pesticides, polluting ecosystems. Hemp doesn’t need pesticides. The original linen was made from hemp. Hemp wicks better than all other plant fibers, letting your skin breath. Hemp is anti-microbial, so clothes stay fresher longer.\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e\n\u003c\/div\u003e\n\u003c\/li\u003e\n\u003c\/ul\u003e","brand":"Vital Hemp","offers":[{"title":"River \/ XS","offer_id":39393363656764,"sku":"40006","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"River \/ S","offer_id":39393363689532,"sku":"40007","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"River \/ M","offer_id":39393363722300,"sku":"40008","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"River \/ L","offer_id":39393363755068,"sku":"40009","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"River \/ XL","offer_id":39393363787836,"sku":"40010","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Aqua \/ XS","offer_id":39393363329084,"sku":"40000","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Aqua \/ S","offer_id":39393363361852,"sku":"40002","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Aqua \/ M","offer_id":39393363394620,"sku":"40003","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Aqua \/ L","offer_id":39393363427388,"sku":"40004","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Aqua \/ XL","offer_id":39393363460156,"sku":"40005","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Driftwood \/ XS","offer_id":39393363492924,"sku":"40001","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Driftwood \/ S","offer_id":39393363525692,"sku":"40002","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Driftwood \/ M","offer_id":39393363558460,"sku":"40003","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Driftwood \/ L","offer_id":39393363591228,"sku":"40004","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Driftwood \/ XL","offer_id":39393363623996,"sku":"40005","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Cloud \/ XS","offer_id":39393363820604,"sku":"40011","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Cloud \/ S","offer_id":39393363853372,"sku":"40012","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Cloud \/ M","offer_id":39393363886140,"sku":"40013","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Cloud \/ L","offer_id":39393363918908,"sku":"40014","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Cloud \/ XL","offer_id":39393363951676,"sku":"40015","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"White \/ XS","offer_id":39411321929788,"sku":"40016","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"White \/ S","offer_id":39411322519612,"sku":"40017","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"White \/ M","offer_id":39411322585148,"sku":"40018","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"White \/ L","offer_id":39411322650684,"sku":"40019","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"White \/ XL","offer_id":39411322978364,"sku":"40020","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Black \/ XS","offer_id":39411322683452,"sku":"40021","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Black \/ S","offer_id":39411326287932,"sku":"40022","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Black \/ M","offer_id":39411324518460,"sku":"40023","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Black \/ L","offer_id":39411319406652,"sku":"40024","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Black \/ XL","offer_id":39411324649532,"sku":"40025","price":44.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/1662\/0479\/products\/vital-hemp-womens-t-shirt-274833.jpg?v=1625427657","url":"https:\/\/www.vitalhemp.com\/products\/womens-vital-tshirt","provider":"Vital Hemp, Inc.","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
